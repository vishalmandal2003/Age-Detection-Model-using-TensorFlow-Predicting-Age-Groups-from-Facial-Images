# Age-Detection-Model-using-TensorFlow-Predicting-Age-Groups-from-Facial-Images
This project is an Age Detection Model built using TensorFlow to predict the age group of individuals based on their facial images. It leverages deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify faces into predefined age categories accurately.
